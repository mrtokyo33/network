Networks are simply things connected. For example, a friendship circle: you are all connected because of similar interests, hobbies, skills ...
Networks can be found in all walks of life:
    A city's public transportation system
    Infrastructure such as the national power grid for electricity
    Meeting and greeting friends or neighbours
    Postal system

In computiing, networking is the same idea, just dispersed to technological devices. A Phone as an example, the reason that you have it is to access things

In computing, a network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions. These devices include everything from your laptop & phone to security cameras, taffic lights and even farming
Networks are integrated into our everyday life




what is internet?
The Internet is a giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself

The first iteration of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence Department and was the first documented networking
However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW)

So the internet is just a network that connect other networks




Identyfying Devices on a Network
To communicate and maintain order, devices must be both identifying and identifiable on a network. What use is it if you don't know whom you're talking to at the end of the day?
Devices on a network are very similar to humans in the fact that we have two ways of being identified:
    our name
    our fingerprints
we can't change our fingerprints. Every human has an individual set of fingerprints which means that even if they change their name, there is still an identity behind it
Devices have the same thing: two means of identification, with one being permeable. These are:
    An IP Address
    A Media Access COntrol (MAC) Address -- Think of this as being a similar to a serial number




IP Addresses
Briefly, an IP address (or Internet Protocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period time
where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing
First, let's split up precisely what an IP address is
    192.168.1.1
    
    192 octet#1 0-255
    168 octet#2 0-255
    1   octet#3 0-255
    1   octet#4 0-255

An IP address is a set of numbers that are divided into four octets. The value of each octet will summarise to be the IP address of the device on the network
This number is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting
What's important to understand here is that IP addresses can change from device to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network

IP Addresses follow a set of standards known as protocols. These protocols are the backbone of networking and force many devices to ccommunicate in the same language
However, we should recall that devices can be on both a private and public network. Depending on where they are will determine what type of IP address they have a public or private IP address
A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices
example:

Device name                     IP Address                      Ip Address type
DESKTOP-KJE57FD                 192.168.1.77                    private
DESKTOP-KJE57FD                 86.157.52.21                    public
CMNatic-PC                      192.168.1.74                    private
CMNatic-PC                      86.157.52.21                    public 

These two devices will be able to use their private IP addresses to communicate with each other
However, any data sent to the Internet from either of these devices will be identified by the same public IP address

Public IP addresses are given by your Internet Service Provider (or ISP) at a monthly fee


As more and more devices become connected, it is becoming increasingly harder to get a public address that isn't already in use
For example, Cisco, an industry giant in the world of networking, estimated that there would be approximately 50 billion devices connected on the Internet by the end of 2021

Enter IP address versions. So far, we have only discussed one version of the Internet Protocol addressing scheme known as IPv4, which uses a numbering system of 2^32 IP addresses (4.29 billion)
IPv6 is a new interaction of the Internet Protocol addressing scheme to help tackle this issue. Although it is seemingly more daunting, it boasts a few benefits:
    Supports to 2^128 of IP addresses (340 trillion+), resolvinf the issue faced with IPv4
    More efficient due to new methodologies


comparison of IP types
    IPv6    2a00:22c4:a531:c500:425f:cce6:c36b:f64d
    IPv4    86.157.52.21




MAC Addresses
Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard
The MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number (a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers) split into two's and separated by a colon
These colons are considered separators. For example, a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d. The first six characters represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number
https://byjus.com/maths/hexadecimal-number-system/

However, an intersting thing with MAC addresses is that they can be faked or "spoofed" in a proccess known as spoofing
This spoofing occurs when a networked device pretends to identify as another using its MAC address
When this occurs, it can often break poorly implemented security designs that assume that devices talking on a network are trustworthy

Take the following scenario: A firewall is configured to allow any communication going to and from the MAC address of the administrator. If a device were to pretend or "spoof" this MAC address
the firewall would now think that it is receiving communication from the administrator when it isn't




PING (ICMP)
Ping is one of the most fundamental network tools avaible to us. Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices 
The time taken for ICMP packets travelling between devices is measured by ping; This measutiing is done using ICMP's echo packet and then ICMP's echo reply form the target device 
Pings can be performed against devices on a network, such as your home network or resources like websites
The ping comes installed on Operating Systems(OSs) such as Linux and Windows.

The syntax to do a simple ping is 
    ping [IP address or website URL]

example:
    ~$ ping 57.144.136.1
    PING 57.144.136.1 (57.144.136.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 57.144.136.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=19.2 ms
    64 bytes from 57.144.136.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=18.9 ms
    64 bytes from 57.144.136.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=15.9 ms
    64 bytes from 57.144.136.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=55 time=21.0 ms
    ^C
    --- 57.144.136.1 ping statistics ---
    4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3004ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 15.863/18.732/20.993/1.842 ms
    

Here we are pinging a device that has the public address 57.144.136.1
Ping informs us that we have sent four ICMP packets, all of which were received with an average time of 3004 milliseconds
